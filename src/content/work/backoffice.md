I developed a project using Django and Vue.js for a company seeking to implement an AI-powered back office to automate customer responses and manage certain data processes more efficiently. The system utilized natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze customer inquiries, automatically generate relevant responses, and categorize incoming data for better decision-making.

By integrating AI into the back office, the solution not only improved response times but also enhanced data organization and streamlined customer service operations. I was responsible for the entire development cycle, from backend design using Django to frontend implementation with Vue.js, ensuring seamless integration of AI models that processed and responded to user inputs in real-time.

This project demonstrated my ability to combine backend development with AI technologies, enhancing both user experience and operational efficiency. It also provided me with hands-on experience in building intelligent systems that directly impact business performance through automation and smart data management.
