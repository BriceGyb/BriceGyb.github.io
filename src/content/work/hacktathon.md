 During my participation in the TrainRail Hackathon, my team developed an innovative solution for ONCF (National Office of Railways) aimed at optimizing passenger train space for parcel transportation. Our project, Colis-Train, leveraged predictive AI models to forecast passenger flow and the volume of passengers on various routes. This data was then used to dynamically adjust available seating, transforming passenger trains into hybrid systems capable of accommodating both passengers and parcels.

To achieve this, we integrated a predictive AI algorithm that analyzed historical passenger data, external factors (like weather, holidays, and events), and real-time data from the trains to make accurate predictions on the number of passengers at different times. Based on these predictions, the system was able to adjust the trainâ€™s capacity by activating retractable seats, effectively converting space to accommodate parcels during less crowded times.

The Colis-Train system not only helped optimize space usage but also improved the efficiency of freight logistics while maintaining a comfortable experience for passengers. This project allowed me to apply AI in a real-world setting, combining my skills in machine learning, data analysis, and system integration to solve complex operational challenges. It was a great opportunity to collaborate with a team of skilled professionals and contribute to a solution that has the potential to revolutionize the way freight is transported on passenger trains.
