Pazoo is a tool designed to enhance your password security by transforming weak passwords into secure ones through an innovative approach. By clicking on animals, each representing a unique mathematical function, Pazoo automatically strengthens your password's complexity and security. 



This guide offers a detailed overview of how Pazoo works, covering everything from its basic functionality and the transformation process using animal nodes, to practical advice on effectively using the website and managing transformed passwords. 



Additionally, it discusses my commitment to simplicity, transparency, and autonomy, ensuring future reliability. The guide also addresses legal responsibilities and includes essential contact information and a glossary of terms.

Project Overview
Pazoo revolutionizes password security by enabling users to transform simple, weak passwords into robust and secure versions through a unique and engaging method. The core functionality of Pazoo involves the user interacting with animal icons, each corresponding to a unique mathematical function. This process strengthens the original password by adding complexity and variability, making it much harder for unauthorized parties to compromise. This innovative approach blends the security benefits of traditional password managers with the personal customization and simplicity of managing your own passwords.

I designed Pazoo to be intuitive and user-friendly, yet highly secure. It operates completely locally within the user’s browser, eliminating the need for external infrastructure. Its open-source nature ensures transparency and encourages community-driven enhancements, positioning it as an ideal alternative to traditional password managers that may face security vulnerabilities and cross-platform issues.

With Pazoo, users gain the ability to generate and maintain strong, consistent passwords across different devices, enhancing their digital security with ease.

How It Works
Pazoo operates on a straightforward yet powerful principle: transforming user-provided passwords into highly secure ones through a series of hash functions represented by animal icons. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of the process:

Initial Password Entry: The user starts by entering a weak, easily memorable password into the input field on the website.

Animal Selection: The user selects a sequence of animal icons, each corresponding to a specific hash function. The positions and functions of these animals are fixed to ensure consistency.

Password Transformation: Each selected animal applies its hash function to the password sequentially, enhancing the password's complexity and security with each step. The hash functions used take a deliberate amount of time to compute, which adds an additional layer of security by significantly slowing down any potential brute-force attacks.

Final Strong Password: The final, highly secure password can then be copied and used on any platform.

Important note: Pazoo does not store any passwords or user data. The entire transformation process happens locally in the user's browser, ensuring privacy and security.

Transformation Process
In this section, I outline how the system behind Pazoo operates, giving you insight into the underlying mechanisms that empower the tool. This information is vital for understanding how your passwords are transformed and ensures you can independently manage your password security if necessary, such as in the event that the website becomes unavailable. Gaining familiarity with these processes allows you to maintain robust password security on your own terms.

Animal Node Functions: How Each Animal Enhances Password Security
Pazoo employs a unique system of animal nodes to represent different hash functions, each with a specific position and associated salt value. This innovative approach allows you to transform an initial password into a highly secure one efficiently.

Here’s how each component of the animal nodes contributes to the password transformation process:

Position: Each animal holds a fixed position within the sequence, which guarantees that using the same sequence will consistently generate the same secure password from a given initial password. This consistency aids in memory retention, as users can rely on visual and kinesthetic memory to recall their specific sequence through repeated interactions.

Salt Value: Attached to each animal node is a unique salt value that mixes with the previous password before hashing. This ensures diverse and unique hash outputs for each animal selected.

Hash Function: Each animal node triggers a specific hash function, which is a cryptographic algorithm that transforms the entered password into a standardized 43-character string. Pazoo employs the Argon2 hash function, known for its memory-intensive properties, which slow down brute-force attacks by requiring more computational resources and time to decipher.

Prefix Addition: At the completion of each hash transformation, a prefix 'Z#' is added to the beginning of the resulting password. This ensures that each password contains a capital letter and a special character. Additionally, this prefix helps users recognize that the password was generated using Pazoo, adding an extra layer of organization and consistency.
