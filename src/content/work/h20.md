During the 2024-2025 academic year, I had the honor of leading the Les DataKnights Artificial Intelligence club at EIGSI Casablanca. Our mission was to make AI more accessible through practical workshops, expert-led conferences, and collaborative projects. 


We initiated innovative activities, from developing AI-based applications to organizing internal competitions aimed at stimulating creativity and research. Through these efforts, the club became a true space for exchange and learning, allowing students to enhance their AI skills while working on real-world challenges.
